# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns that deal with object communication and how they interact and distribute responsibilities. They provide ways to define communication between classes and objects.

## Different Types of Behavioral Design Patterns

1. [**Template Method Pattern**](./template): Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.

2. [**State Pattern**](./state): Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

3. [**Chain of Responsibility Pattern**](./chain_of_responsibility): Decouples sender and receiver of a request based on type of request. This pattern comes under behavioral patterns.

4. [**Command Pattern**](./command): Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with queues, requests, or operations.

5. [**Mediator Pattern**](./mediator): Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.

6. [**Observer Pattern**](./observer): Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Conclusion

Behavioral design patterns offer various techniques for improved interaction between diverse objects, encapsulating behaviors in an object and delegating responsibilities. By understanding and applying these patterns, developers can ensure that system components interact in a robust and flexible manner. For more detailed information on each behavioral design pattern, please refer to the respective documentation and examples in the corresponding directories.
