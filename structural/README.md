# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns that deal with object composition. They provide ways to ensure that different parts of a system work together in a structured and efficient manner. Structural design patterns help to ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to change with it.

## Different Types of Structural Design Patterns

1. [**Adapter Pattern**](./adapter): Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.

2. [**Composite Pattern**](./composite): Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

3. [**Decorator Pattern**](./decorator): Adds new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.

4. [**Facade Pattern**](./facade): Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

5. [**Proxy Pattern**](./proxy): Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## Conclusion

Structural design patterns offer various techniques for creating and managing class and object composition. By understanding and applying these patterns, developers can ensure that system components interact in a robust and flexible manner. For more detailed information on each structural design pattern, please refer to the respective documentation and examples in the corresponding directories.
