# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We appreciate your effort and to ensure that your contributions are integrated smoothly, we request you to follow these guidelines.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. Each type of design pattern has its own directory (e.g., creational, structural, behavioural).
2. Inside each directory, there are subdirectories for each design pattern.
3. Each design pattern directory contains the following files:
    - `README.md`: A detailed explanation of the design pattern, including the problem it solves, the solution it provides, its applicability, how to implement it, and its pros and cons.
    - `src/`: The source code for the design pattern, including all classes and interfaces.
    - `image/`: Any images or diagrams related to the design pattern.

## README Files

Each design pattern directory contains a `README.md` file that explains the design pattern in detail. The README file should include the following sections:

1. **Explanation**: A detailed explanation of the design pattern.
2. **Image**: An image or diagram that illustrates the design pattern.
3. **Problem**: A description of the problem the design pattern solves.
4. **Solution**: An explanation of how the design pattern solves the problem.
5. **UML Class Diagram**: A UML class diagram of the design pattern.
6. **Applicability**: When to use the design pattern.
7. **How to Implement**: Steps to implement the design pattern.
8. **Pros and Cons**: The advantages and disadvantages of the design pattern.

Each type of design pattern (creational, structural, behavioural) has its own `README.md` file that lists the design patterns in that category. This file should include links to the individual design pattern directories.
